## 🌍 Project Overview

Millions lack reliable access to clean water—a basic human right. *AquaLens* is an AI-driven tool that analyzes regional water quality data to uncover hidden patterns. By clustering similar regions based on indicators like pH, turbidity, lead, arsenic, and population density, this project helps pinpoint vulnerable communities and optimize intervention strategies.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Cleaned missing values and normalized water quality metrics for consistency.

2. **Clustering with K-Means:**  
   Applied K-Means to group regions with similar water quality characteristics.

3. **Visualization:**  
   Used PCA to reduce dimensionality and visualize the clusters.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   Silhouette score used to assess clustering effectiveness.

## 📈 Results

- Discovered 3 distinct water quality clusters:
  - Cluster 0: High contamination, dense populations — urgent intervention.
  - Cluster 1: Low contaminants, sparse populations — minimal risk.
  - Cluster 2: Borderline values — candidates for proactive support.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

- **Bias Risk:** Some regions may have incomplete data—steps taken to mitigate skew by balancing samples.
- **Social Impact:** Promotes equitable resource allocation by focusing on underserved areas.
- **Transparency:** Codebase is fully open-source and documented.
